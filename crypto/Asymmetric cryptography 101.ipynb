    "## Asymmetric cryptography\n",
    "Erez Doron, CellBuddy<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Here we will try to give basic intuition on asymmetric cryptography. why is it called 'Asummetric' ? because we use a different key to encrypt than to decrypt.<br> \n",
    "Note that we try to keep things Simple (vs being Acurate).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encrypting\n",
    "Let's say Bob wants to send Alice some data withough Eve Reading it<br>\n",
    "How can this be done ?<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Actually, it is very simple:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Alice chooses a pair of keys ( 3 and 7 ) and a modulo ( 10).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "What is modulo 10 ? it means leaving only the <b>rightmost digit</b><br>\n",
    "10<span style=\"color:green; font-weight: bold;\">3</span> modulo 10 is <span style=\"color:green; font-weight: bold;\">3</span><br>\n",
    "2<span style=\"color:green; font-weight: bold;\">7</span> modulo 10 is <span style=\"color:green; font-weight: bold;\">7</span><br>\n",
    "1<span style=\"color:green; font-weight: bold;\">4</span> modulo 10 is <span style=\"color:green; font-weight: bold;\">4</span><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Alice publishes her public key ( 7 )  and moduo ( 10 )<br>\n",
    "It's ok for everyone (even Eve) to know the public key and modulo.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "##### 3. Bob encreypts the data<br>\n",
    "Let's say data is 2<br>\n",
    "Bob encrypts by multiplying the data ( 2 ) by the public key ( 7 )<br>\n",
    "2x7=14. modulo 10 -> 4<br>\n",
    "(*) Real encryption is done by raising to a power, in this example we multiply instead, to make it simplear<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "##### 4. Bob sends the Encrypted data ( 4 ) to Alice, Alice decrypys<br>\n",
    "Here the decryption process is the same as the encryption process, <br>\n",
    "The only difference is the key - use private key.<br>\n",
    "How: Alice multiplies the received data ( 4 ) by the private key ( 3 )<br>\n",
    "4 x 3 = 12. module 10 -> 2<br>\n",
    "Alice gets the original data sent by Bob<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As you can see, we use a different key for Encrypting than the one used for Decrypting. This is why it is called \"Asymmetric\"  Cryptography<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signing\n",
    "##### 1. Alice signs her data, then publishes the data and the signature<br>\n",
    "To sign, alice encrypt with her private key.<br>\n",
    "Alices takes the data ( 2 ) multiply with the private key ( 3 )<br>\n",
    "2 x 3 = 6. module 10 -> 6<br>\n",
    "6 is the Signature. Note that only Alice, which knows the private key can do that<br>\n",
    "Alice can now publish the dara ( 2 ) and the signature ( 6 )\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Everyone can verify that Alice's signature<br>\n",
    "As everyone knows Alice's public key. anyone can check by decrypting:<br>\n",
    "encrypetd data (6) x public key ( 7 ) = 42. module 10 -> 2<br>\n",
    "which proves it was signed by Alice (which has the private key)<br>\n",

    "# Real world example, step by step<br>\n",
    "## Generate RSA key pair<br>\n",
    "1. we need to choose two prime numbers. we call them P and Q. <br>\n",
    "A prime does not divide to any other number other than itself and 1.for example: 4 is not prime as you can write 4 as 2x2=4. 6 can be written as 2x3=6, however 7 can only be written as itself x one, i.e. 1x7=7 so it is prime.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For this example we pick P=13 and Q=11. as you can see both are prime.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. calculate N and Phi and select a matching E<br>\n",
    "N = P x Q = 13 x 11 = 143<br>\n",
    "PHI = (P-1)(Q-1) = 12 x 10 = 120<br>\n",
    "As you can see, neither N nor PHI is prime.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Now we pick E - the smallest number that PHI can not divide. i.e. that we can not write PHI = E x something.<BR>\n",
    "PHI = 120 = 2 x 60 -> we can't pick E=2<BR>\n",
    "PHI = 120 = 3 x 40 -> we can't pick E=3<BR>\n",
    "PHI = 120 = 4 x 30 -> we can't pick E=4<BR>\n",
    "PHI = 120 = 5 x 24 -> we can't pick E=5<BR>\n",
    "PHI = 120 = 6 x 20 -> we can't pick E=6<BR>\n",
    "PHI = 120 not equal to 7 x somthing. so we pick E=7<BR>\n",
    "<BR> \n",
    "3. calculate D = 1/E<br>\n",
    "We need to calculate D which is 1/E modulo PHI. i.e. D=1/E (mod PHI), or DE=1 (mod PHI)<br>\n",
    "As we work with integer numbers, we can not divide 1 by 7 as this will result in a fruction. however as we work in modulo PHI, (1 mod PHI) is equal to (PHI+1 mod PHI) as well as (2xPHI+1 mod PHI) as well as (IxPHI+1 mod PHI) for any positive integer I. if I=E-1 we get ((E-1)xPHI+1 mod PHI) = (1 mod PHI). however in our case (E=7, PHI=120), (E-1)xPHI+1 is a multiple of E. so 1/E=((E-1)xPHI+1)/E mod N).<br>\n",
    "lets check: (7-1)x120+1 = 6x120+1=721. 721=7x103<br>\n",
    "so we caluclated D = 103<br>\n",
    "lets check: 103x7 mod 120=721 mod 120= 1<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Our generated keypair are D and E, our modulo is N. i.e. <b>generated keypair: 103, 7 and modulo: 143</b><br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## Encrypt and decrypt<br>\n",
    "In contrast to the tutorials on top in which we multipied. real Encryption is done by rasing to a power (or better - use elliptic curves).<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Lets encrypt. lets say our data is the number 12. we encrypt it by raising to the power of the encryption key<br>\n",
    "Encrypted Data=14^7 mod 143=14x14x14x...x14 (7 times) mod 143=105413504 mod 143 = 53.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "When we want to decrypt, we encounter a problem. our key is 103. and raising 53 to the power 103 resulst in a very big number  - 178 digits long, and we chose a very small key 2 digits only), real world keys are a lot larger (300 digits and more). so how it is done ?<br>\n",
    "Instead of doing 53x53x53x...x53 (103 times) and only then doing mod 143. we can do as many mod 143 as we like.<br>\n",
    "i.e. ((53x53x53 mod 143)x53x53x53 mod 143)x153 ... etc.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "actually as 103=5x5x4+3, we can do (((53^5 mod 143)^5 mod 143)^4 mod 143)x53^3 mod 143 <br>\n",
    "53^5=418195493. 418195493 mod 143=1<br>\n",
    "1^5 mod 143 is of course just 1. same with 1^4 mod 143 = 1.<br>\n",
    "We are left with 53^3 mod 143=148877 mod 143 = 14<br> \n",
    "<b> We got 14 which is the original data</b><br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## Can it be broken ?\n",
    "Above we chose two prime numbers - P and Q, and derived everything from them.<br>\n",
    "Everybody can know our modulo N ( N = 143 ), which is N = P x Q<br>\n",
    "So if it was easy. anyone cound break N into P and Q (called Integer Factorizations), and as we did - derive the keys.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Well, it is not east. actually one should check for all prime numbers smaller than the square root of N, if N is divided by them. As N in real life is at least 300 digits long, this is a very exhustive task, which even with some algorithms which make it a little simpler - would take a very very log time and so is unpractical.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "However this is true for classic compuers which try one at a time. Is it also the case for <b>Quantum computers</b> ? Apperently not<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Countrary to common belief, a quantum computer is not just a faster computer. It is actually different than classic computers, I wouldn't suggest writing a pacman game for a quantum computer.<br>\n",
    "Quantum computers are fit to problems that can be converted to specific problems that can be solved by them.<br>\n",
    "It turns out that Integer factorizations can be converted by an algorith called \"Shor's Algorithm\" to a problem of finding the frequency of repitition. Though that doesn't make it easier for a classic computer, this is a problem that can be easily solved by a Quantom computer<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Quantum computers already shown to be able to break the code for keys 3 and 7 abive which are very small, however quantum computers are still in their infancy, and it will take some time until they will be able to break real encryption.<br>\n",
    "However it is comming very soon ..."
